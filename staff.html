          <p class="lead">Hi, I’m Soo Yeon, one of the tutors for the newly launched Writing Center! I’m in my senior year, studying in the Comparative Literature and Culture department. I like writing long rambling letters that don’t go anywhere and jotting down random thoughts on paper. Of course, that’s not exactly our goal in the Writing Center, where we will kickstart our journey to become better writers in an academic environment. In other words, we will work together on effectively employing key words, crafting clear and concise sentences, and laying out well-supported arguments to polish your writing and make your essay shine. Still, writing is something I genuinely enjoy in and out of class, and I hope to share some of that love in the Center. As long as it does not compromise coherence, I’m always happy to see some literary flourish. You may be forced to write that essay, but your professors also have to read it. Why not make your essay unique and interesting for all your future readers by bringing out your own style? Bring your best writing and we’ll work hard to make it better. Hope to see many of you soon!</p>

          <p class="lead">My name is Gene Png, and I’m a senior majoring in Asian Studies. I grew up in Singapore where chewing gum is––in fact!––legal. I enjoy reading historical fiction, creative non-fiction, and junior picture books. My favourite book is <i>The World of Pooh</i> by A. A. Milne, and my dog is named after Christopher Robin. When it comes to writing, I believe in the power of plain yet sincere language. I prefer it when a piece reveals itself simply to its readers whether it is in the form of an argumentative essay or creative writing. I started to write more seriously last year, and I’ve been learning many things about writing and my relationship with writing. I’m excited to embark on this new journey to learn alongside other writers in UIC!</p>

          <p class="lead">Hello there! I'm KT Eddy, an Asian Studies Major, class of 15.5. I am a stickler for grammar, advocate for the Oxford comma, and combatant to the dreaded passive voice. I believe the greatest foundation for both writing and tutoring is communication. Although I wield the mighty red pen, my most important goal is to make sure that you, the writer, are not only heard but also that your own voice shines through your writing!</p>

          <p class="lead">I am Phuong Nguyen, class of 16.5, a Vietnamese student currently majoring in Asian studies. I believe that the secret of good academic writing is through research and sound arguments. Thus, it is crucial to invest enough time in contemplating the required materials to brainstorm a compelling thesis statement and structure ideas. In my sessions, I will rely on Socratic debate to stimulate and guide your critical thinking. I hope that the process of being cornered with multiple questions will strengthen your original argument or enable you to discover more profound approaches that are implicit in your thinking and writing. 
As a non-native English speaker who had never taken classes in English before entering UIC, I understand the struggle and know how to correct common technical mistakes that non-native students face in academic writing. Don’t be shy to reach out for help, I am here to listen and give suggestions that will make writing essays less of a “painful” task.
